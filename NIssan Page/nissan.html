            <p>    
                In 1934, the Tokyo-based Jidosha-Seizo Kabushiki-Kaisha (Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in English) takes on a new name: Nissan Motor Company.
                <br><br>
                Jidosha-Seizo Kabushiki-Kaisha had been established in December 1933. The company’s new name, adopted in June 1934, was an abbreviation for Nippon Sangyo, 
                a “zaibatsu”(or holding company) belonging to Tobata’s founder, Yoshisuke Aikawa. 
                <br><br>
                Nissan produced its first Datsun (a descendant of the Dat Car, a small, 
                boxy passenger vehicle designed by Japanese automotive pioneer Masujiro Hashimoto that was first produced in 1914) at its Yokohama plant in April 1935. 
                <br><br>
                The company began exporting cars to Australia that same year. 
                <br><br>
                Beginning in 1938 and lasting throughout World War II, Nissan converted entirely from producing small passenger cars to producing trucks and military vehicles. 
                <br><br>
                Allied occupation forces seized much of Nissan’s production operations in 1945 and didn’t return full control to Nissan until a decade later.

            <p>
                The first Skyline GT-R, known by the internal Nissan designation PGC10, was released on 4 February 1969, and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Store when the Prince company was integrated into Nissan operations in 1966.
                <br><br>
                It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show, advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline's racing heraldry.
                <br><br>
                Equipped with the 2.0L DOHC S20 Inline-six engine producing 119 kW (160 bhp; 162 PS) at 7,000 rpm and 176 N⋅m (130 lb⋅ft) at 5,600 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual transmission. 
                The first Skyline GT-R rode on a semi-trailing arm strut suspension. It was available as a coupe in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10. A total of 1,945 PGC and KPGC10 Skyline GT-Rs were produced.

            <p>
                The KPGC110, was released in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo Motor Show. Powered by a 1989 cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. 
                The KPGC110 car came with both front and rear disk brakes, suspension was via a semi-trailing ring arm setup while minor aerodynamic parts were added.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, the second generation GT-R was unsuccessful, for a gasoline crisis hit in the early 1970s, drying out any demand for high-performance sports cars. 
                A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade, this was the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989.

                <h2>Third Generation - R32 - 1989 - 1994</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The R32 Skyline debuted in 1989, available as either a 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan, all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines, which had improved heads (the twelve port inlet was gone) and used the ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) injection system.
                <br><br>
                Most models had HICAS four-wheel steering, with the rear wheels being hydraulically linked to the front steering. The 2.5-litre GTS-25 became one of the first Japanese production cars to feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The GTS-t came in standard and Type M configurations, with the Type M having larger five-stud 16-inch wheels, four piston front callipers and twin piston rears plus other minor differences.
                <br><br>
                ABS was optional (except for the GT-R and GTS-4), mechanical LSD was standard on the GTR and viscous LSD was standard on all turbo models and optional on all but the GXi. Nissan also produced 100 Australian models of the R32. In addition, there was a 4WD version of the GTS-t Type M, called the GTS-4.
                <br><br>
                This generation was considered a "compact" under Japanese legislation that determined the amount of tax liability based on exterior dimensions. The smaller engines were offered so as to provide Japanese buyers the ability to choose which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The station wagon bodystyle was discontinued, and replaced by the Nissan Stagea.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>R32 GT-R</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The R32 GT-R was first produced in 1988 including prototype cars. The first six Nismos were built in 1989. The other 554 NISMO GT-Rs were all built in 1990 in Gunmetal Grey. The RB26DETT engine actually produced ~320 PS (316 hp), but it was understated due to the Japanese car makers' "gentlemen's agreement" not to exceed 280 PS (276 hp). 
                The engine was designed for ~500 hp in racing trim, and then muzzled by the exhaust, boost restriction, and ECU. After this increase the car would put out ~310 hp (~230 kW) and could do 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.8 seconds.
                <br><br>
                The GT-R had a significantly larger intercooler, larger brakes, and aluminium front guards and bonnet. Other distinguishing features include flared front and rear wheel arches. More supportive seats were fitted, and the turbo boost gauge and digital clock were removed replaced with a torque meter that indicated how much torque was being delivered to the front wheels (0%–50%). 
                Oil temp, voltage, and turbo boost gauges were fitted just above the climate control.
                <br><br>
                The Porsche 959 was Nissan's target when designing the GT-R. Chief engineer, Naganori Ito, intended to use the car for Group A racing, so the design specification was drawn up in conjunction with a copy of the Group A rules. 
                The Nordschleife production car record at the time of development was 8'45" – set by a Porsche 944. Nissan test driver Hiroyoshi Katoh reset the record with a time of 8'20".
                <br><br>
                The R32 GT-R dominated Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), winning 29 races from 29 starts, taking the series title every year from 1989 to 1993. It took 50 races from 50 starts from 1991 to 1997 in the N1 Super Taikyu.
                The R32 GT-R was introduced into the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1990 and promptly ended the reign of the previously all-conquering Ford Sierra Cosworth, winning Bathurst 1000 classic in 1991 and 1992. 
                This success led to the Australian motoring press nicknaming the car Godzilla due to it being a "monster from Japan". As Australia was the first export market for the car the name quickly spread. Such was the GT-R's dominance that it was a significant factor in the demise of Group A Touring Car racing, the formula being scrapped soon after. 
                JTCC was similarly blighted by the R32 GT-R, and splintered soon after, leading to the switch to the Supertouring category and also indirectly to the GT500 category of today.
                <br><br>
                When originally designed, the homologation rulebook mandated 16-inch wheels, so that's what the GT-R got. This limited the size of the brakes, and the four-piston calipers used by Nissan were not competitive. After the rules changed to allow 17-inch wheels, the GT-R V-spec (for Victory) emerged in February 1993 wearing 17" BBS mesh wheels (225/50/17) covering larger Brembo calipers. 
                The clutch actuation changed from a push to a pull system and the car had a standard mechanical rear differential (the electronic rear differential did not show up until the R33 V-Spec). A year later, the V-Spec II appeared with a new sticker and wider tires (245/45 17).

                <h2>Fourth Generation - R33 - 1995 - 1998</h2>
            <p>
                The R33 Skyline was introduced in August 1993. Slightly heavier than the R32, it was available in coupe and sedan body configurations. The R33 was the safest of the models with a rating of 3.8 out of 5.5 accordingly; the airbag system and internal crash bars made this vehicle significantly safer than previous models. All models now used a six-cylinder engine. 
                Nissan took the unusual step of down-grading the GTS model to have only the RB20E, while the twin-cam of the R32 GTS was discontinued. The 2.0 L turbo RB20DET GTS-t was also discontinued and was replaced with the GTS-25t which was equipped with the larger RB25DET and featured HICAS as standard in all GTS-25t sub-models except the Type G.
                <br><br>
                Some models came equipped with a new version of the HICAS 4-wheel steering system called Super HICAS. This computer controlled system was first used on the R32 GT-R. Super HICAS used electric actuators to steer the rear, as opposed to the hydraulic HICAS. 
                This generation was no longer considered a "compact" under Japanese legislation that determined the amount of tax liability based on exterior dimensions.
                <br><br>
                As an option, an active limited slip differential was available instead of the standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost by one of the wheels indicated by a light on the dash if the LSD engaged. 
                Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the tachometer.
                <br><br>
                The RB25DE and RB25DET engines also became equipped with NVCS (variable inlet cam phasing). NVCS equipped RB series engine have a bulge on the front of the cam cover. To celebrate their 40th anniversary, Nissan introduced a very rare 4-door GT-R. 
                Two versions of the 4-door GT-R were available from Nissan's subsidiaries: the first was produced by Autech, and the second was a joint Autech/Nismo project.
                <br><br>
                A Nissan Laurel C34 based wagon was released in September 1996, called the Stagea. It is widely regarded as a compatriot of the Skyline, rather than the Laurel it was based on, owing to drivetrain configurations—Commonly AWD using ATTESA ET-S. A common modification on the Stagea is to fit it with an R34 skyline front, in effect making an R34-lookalike wagon. 
                A manual transmission was only available on the RS-Four and RS-Four V models. There was also an Autech tuned Stagea, the 260RS; released with full GT-R running gear, including an RB26DETT engine and manual transmission, a unique body kit, 17" BBS style alloys, and GT-R instrumentation.

            <h3>R33 Spec 2 (1996)</h3>
            <p>
                The R33 Spec 2 continued the concepts introduced in the R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they do not meet the frontal impact standards. 
                (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) 
                For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. 
                <br><br>
                Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the Spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), 
                the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. 
                Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted. The R33 ceased production in February 1998 with the 40th Anniversary R33.

            <h3>R33 GT-R</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The previous R32 model was a well proven build but the R32 wasn't without faults and suffered with uplift and balance issues. Along with that, Nissan was as other Japanese companies were under strict restrictions on power gains. So Nissan had to combat all these areas so the sophisticated strength programme was made.
                <br><br>
                Nissan increased the width by about one inch on the R33 to the R32 and made it about 4 inches longer. This gave the R33 a longer wheelbase overall and lower stance mixed with new technology now from the computer aerodynamic age. Each line on the R33 was intended to give the car ultimate aerodynamics with wider gaps in the bumper and angles of air movement which allowed better cooling, 
                in addition to the fuel tank lifted; the battery moved to the boot/trunk. Rigidity points were added mixed with improvements on the Attessa and Hicas all now offered the R33 with the best aerodynamics, balance, and handling.
                <br><br>
                Nissan engineers also found other ways to reduce weight, even by a few grams. This includes: Hollowing out the side door beams. Using high tensile steel on body panels. Reduction in sound deadening materials. Super HICAS becoming electric. Hollowing out of rear stabilizer bar. Use of high tensile springs front and rear. Shrinking the ABS actuator. 
                Light aluminum wheels with higher rigidity The front and rear axles were made of aluminum (as in the BNR32), but so were engine mount insulators and brackets. New plastics were used for: fuel tank, head lamps, super high strength "PP" bumpers, air cleaner, changing the headlining material, changing material of rear spoiler.
                <br><br>
                All this put together meant we saw an improved time against the R32 of 21 seconds faster around the Nürburgring and 23 seconds faster in V spec trim, still making the R33 the fastest Skyline around the Nürburgring. The BCNR33 GT-R version also had the same RB26DETT engine that the BNR32 was equipped with, although torque had been improved, 
                due to changes in the turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a sleeve bearing to a ball bearing, but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, sleeve bearing).
                <br><br>
                From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS four-wheel-drive system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.
                <br><br>
                A limited edition model was created in 1996, called the <a href="#400R" style="color: blueviolet">NISMO 400R</a>, that produced 400 hp (298 kW) from a road-tuned version of Nissan's Le Mans engine.[42] A stronger six-speed Getrag gearbox was used.
                <br><br>
                An R33 GT-R driven by Dirk Schoysman lapped the Nordschleife in less than 8 minutes. The Skyline GT-R R33 is reported to be the first production car to break 8 minutes, at 7 minutes and 59 seconds. Other manufacturers had caught up since the R32 was released, and the R33 never dominated motorsport to the extent of the R32. 
                The R33 saw victory in the JGTC GT500 dominating the class and taking victory each year until its final racing year in which it was finally beaten by the Mclaren F1 GTR.
                <br><br>
                The R33 saw huge favour in the tuning world with it being a popular model on the Wangan and top tuning companies building heavily tuned version from Top Secret ran by Smokey Nagata to Jun etc. and later by companies like Sumo. 
                HKS GT-R would hold a drag series record for several years in there drag series making a record win of 7.671-second pass at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway with Tetsuya Kawasaki behind the wheel and taking it to be the World's fastest AWD car.

                <h2>Fifth Generation - R34 - 1999 - 2002</h2>
            <p>
                In May 1998, the HR34, ER34, ENR34, and BNR34 marked the introduction of the more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly RB25DET NEO engine. The RB20E engine was discontinued in the R34 base model (GT), and the RB20DE, after last being used in the R32 Skyline, was reintroduced in the updated NEO guise. 
                The R34 GT, powered by the RB20DE NEO and coupled with a five-speed gearbox, became the most fuel-efficient straight-six Skyline to date (of any shape). The 4-speed automatic transmission available on some models was retained, and was upgraded with tiptronic-style manual controls. 
                The 25GT Turbo coupe variant (often abbreviated as GT-T) was sold in Singapore, New Zealand and Hong Kong from 1998 to 2000 respectively. They were the only three countries besides Japan that sold the R34 25GT Turbo model Skylines new. All Japanese Nissan Prince Store locations that sold the Skyline were renamed Nissan Red Stage.
                <br><br>
                Nissan introduced two new models for the base vehicle, the 25GT-X and the 25GT-V. The 25GT-X was only available as a sedan and included optional extras over the 25GT and 25GT Turbo such as tinted rear windows and pop-up LCD display that replaced the triple cluster on the turbo models. 
                The 25GT-V was a naturally-aspirated variation that came standard with the upgraded 4-piston front and 2-piston rear Sumitomo calipers and 17" wheels only found on the turbo models.
                <br><br>
                In August 2000, the R34 received a facelift which changed the front bumper to a new, sleek design and Xenon headlights were optional across the entire range. For the interior, pedals were changed from rubber to aluminium and the steering wheel and gear shift knob were now made of genuine leather. 
                The center console and dials now had an iridium-silver appearance. Optional extras for the R34 included exterior aero which consists of redesigned front and rear bumpers, side skirts and a wrap-around spoiler on the rear which was only available for the coupe. 
                Optional tuning NISMO parts for the R34 included shock absorbers, exhaust system, intercooler, sway bars, oil cooler, and limited slip differential.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>R34 GT-R</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with a revised chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos received a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. 
                The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. 
                <br><br>
                The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen on any other model skyline was the display unit at the top of the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. 
                This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. 
                There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by. Other features such as the battery being located under the back seat of the car made more room available in the engine bay.

                <h2>The GT-R (R35) - 2008 to Current.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT. 
                Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.
                <br><br>
                The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, launching in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. 
                Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nissan chief creative officer, Shirō Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series. Nakamura stated: "The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car; it had to really reflect Japanese culture."
                <br><br>
                Nissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of the vehicle, while the European designers sculpted the roofline.
                <br><br>
                Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Platform</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                As of 2014 the GT-R was the only model built on Nissan's Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture introduced in its 2001 (V35) Skyline. It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs similar to those used in racecar construction. 
                Alcoa aluminum is used for the hood, trunk lid and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminum front shock towers and inner door structures. Outer body panels are stamped using multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. 
                The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front crossmember/radiator support.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Exterior</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nissan developed a 6-stage paint process with double clear coat and chip-resistant paint for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Optional Features</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Premium Nissan GT-R has a body-colored rear spoiler whereas the Black Edition has a dry carbon-fiber rear spoiler. Both the Premium and Black Edition GT-R are fitted with (LED) headlights, automatic on/off headlights, LED daytime running lights, 
                LED taillights and brake lights, dual heated body-color power outside mirrors, power folding outside mirrors, flush-mounted aluminum door handles, four 5" exhaust outlets with polished tips and UV-reducing solar glass.
                <br><br>
                For the 2014 model year, Nissan introduced a limited production Track Edition GT-R which deletes the rear seats (saving 22 lbs over the Black Edition) and adds more aggressive suspension, carbon fiber air inlets, improved brake cooling, a unique front spoiler, and new black and gray leather Recaro front seats.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Nissan GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT V6 engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) DOHC V6 with plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) turbochargers provide forced induction. 
                Models manufactured between 2007 and 2010 produce a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 485 PS (357 kW; 478 hp) at 6400 rpm and 434 lb⋅ft (588 N⋅m) at 3200–5200 rpm. The engine also meets California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. 
                <br><br>
                A curb weight of 1,730 or 1,736 kg (3,814 or 3,827 lb) with side curtain airbags is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminum used for the hood, trunk, and doors. 
                A rear mounted six-speed BorgWarner designed dual clutch semi-automatic transmission built by Aichi Machine Industry is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system to provide power to all four wheels and along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC-R) to aid in stability. Three shift modes can also be selected for various conditions. 
                <br><br>
                Beginning in 2010, engine power and torque were upgraded to 390 kW (530 PS; 523 hp) at 6400 rpm and 612 N⋅m (451 lbf⋅ft) at 3200–6000 rpm respectively. Models produced in 2012 again featured improved engine output (406.5 kW (553 PS; 545 hp) at 6400 rpm and 628 N⋅m (463 lbf⋅ft) at 3200–5800 rpm). 
                The next-generation GTR is expected to be a hybrid, powered by a combination of the GT-R LM Nismo derived 3.0 liter V6 and a battery/motor system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2011 Facelift</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The revised GT-R features an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545 bhp (406 kW; 553 PS)[24] and 612 N⋅m (451 lb⋅ft) of torque from 3,200 to 6,000 rpm. Changes also include a new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. 
                <br><br>
                Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. This new version is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment features and USB port with iPod connectivity. 
                <br><br>
                The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>SpecV</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nissan introduced the GT-R SpecV on January 7, 2009 at the 2009 Tokyo Auto Salon. This version uses carbon fiber trim inside and out, and has no rear seat. In addition, a new colour was introduced limited to the SpecV, LAC Black Opal.
                <br><br>
                The GT-R SpecV is powered by the standard twin-turbo 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) V6 with no increase in horsepower. A new high gear boost controller that allows a temporary increase in boost pressure to the IHI twin turbochargers, now larger than those on the standard GT-R, should deliver more torque in mid to high-range revs. Other mechanical changes include a titanium exhaust, reworked suspension, carbon ceramic brakes, and 20-inch (510 mm) Nismo wheels. 
                Overall weight is decreased by 132 lb (60 kg) over the standard GT-R.
                <br><br>
                Sales began in Japan on February 2, 2009 at seven preselected dealers staffed specially trained mechanics knowledgeable about racing circuit driving. The price was ¥15,750,000 (about US$160,000. The SpecV was also sold in Europe and the Middle East. A total of 109 SpecV were built, 77 for Japan, 24 for Europe, 1 for United Kingdom and 7 for Middle East.
                <br><br>
                In Auto Express testing the SpecV posted a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 3.20 seconds, pulled 1.12 g on the skidpad and 74.7 mph in the slalom. An earlier tested Corvette ZR1 (2011) resulted in an identical slalom speed but a lower 1.06 g on the skidpad.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>GT-R NISMO</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nissan introduced a NISMO Edition GT-R for model year 2014. US price increased almost 50% to US$149,990.
                <br><br>
                In the new model, power increases to 441 kW; 592 bhp; 600 PS at 6800 rpm and 652 N⋅m (481 lb⋅ft) at 3200-5800 rpm of torque. The top speed remains the same at 196 mph (315 km/h), and the gear-ratios do not change in the Dual-clutch transmission. The fuel tank capacity is 74 L (19.5 US gal; 16.3 imp gal). Additional front and rear brake cooling ducts are added, and a full NISMO tuned suspension is installed, including a hollow 17.3 mm (0.68 in) rear stabilizer bar from the NISMO performance division.
                <br><br>
                Special edition forged alloys by RAYS in 20" size are included. The standard GT-R's aluminum trunk lid is swapped out for a full carbon fiber panel and additional spot welds and adhesive help strengthen the chassis. A front splitter with carbon fiber air ducts up front add to the special NISMO full aerodynamic package, while a large racing style carbon wing finishes off the rear.
                <br><br>
                Inside, the NISMO edition has special seats with black and red color treatment made with synthetic suede. The instrument binnacle and steering wheel are also covered in synthetic suede. The Bose stereo system does not have active noise control. The gauges have some red color treatment as well. NISMO-specific options are low-gloss matte gray paint and a full titanium exhaust with additional heatsinks. These changes, in aggregate, reduce weight by 17 kg (38 lb), which is the reason that the GT-R accelerates even faster than before.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nissan states the GT-R can reach a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph), Motor Trend recorded a top speed of 313.8 km/h (195.0 mph). In tests the original production model was shown to be capable of achieving 0-97 km/h (60 mph) times as low as 3.2 seconds using "launch control". Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. 
                <br><br>
                Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term "launch control", which refers to the act of turning off Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of product planning John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that "we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'". 
                The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.
                <br><br>
                The updated GT-R now has a launch mode called "R-Mode Start". The system allows a maximum of 4 consecutive hard launches before locking itself out, after which it can be unlocked by driving normally for 1.5 miles. The increased engine output of later models combined with the "R-Mode Start" has lowered the 0-97 km/h (60 mph) time to 2.7 seconds. 
                Motor Trend achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.6 s at 193.1 km/h (120.0 mph). Autocar achieved a 0-160 km/h (100 mph) time of 8.5 seconds.
                <br><br>
                With a manufacturer claimed lap time of 7:26.7 on the base model's Dunlop tires and previously 7:29 min on standard Japanese market tires, the GT-R is currently one of the fastest handbuilt cars to lap the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit. Porsche has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. 
                Porsche claims to have conducted a test of a factory stock, European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissans. Nissan disputed the former and implied the later claim in October 2008.

                The German magazine sport auto achieved a time of 7:50 on the Nürburgring with a car supplied to them by Nissan during an initial short test in 2007, while testing by Drivers Republic of a GT-R and 911 GT2 in stock form resulted in times of 7:56 for the GT-R and 7:49 for the GT2 respectively. Both tests were conducted in partially damp conditions and by automotive journalists rather than professional track drivers. 
                In 2009, in a full "super test" sport auto achieved a time of 7:38 minutes on the Nürburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma, identical to a later "super test" Corvette ZR1 time. In a first test with the facelifted GT-R model, 'sport auto' recorded a lap time of 7:34 on the Nürburgring with a standard GT-R driven by Horst von Saurma.
                <br><br>
                According to Nissan the GT-R improved its Nürburgring lap time in October 2012 to 7 minutes and 19.1 seconds. This made it the 9th fastest ever production car around the Nürburgring at the time. Nissan claimed that it lost half a second in traffic, making a potential lap time of 7 minutes and 18.6 seconds.
                <br><br>
                On September 30, 2013, the Nissan GT-R NISMO N-Attack, driven by Michael Krumm in a test conducted by Nissan, set a time of 7:08.68, making it the 8th fastest road-legal production vehicle around the track as of April 2018.

            <p>
                Fifth Gear tested the GT-R along with the Mitsubishi Evo FQ 400 in their short autotest agility track and their larger test track. The GT-R was a second quicker than the Evo in terms of speed {0-60} but the Evo proved to handle better than the GT-R on the autotest track. On the larger track the GT-R was 3 seconds a lap quicker than the Evo FQ 400.
                <br><br>
                Autocar performed several head to head comparisons involving the GT-R and competing vehicles. In the first, against the Porsche 911 GT3 and BMW M3, the GT-R was declared to be faster around the test track. A second test on the Isle of Man on a 4.5 km closed public road, featured with the Audi R8, Lotus Elise, and Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. 
                The GT-R's time of 1:56.69 was behind the Gallardo's 1:55.99 time, however, because the GT-R was Japanese-spec, its top speed was limited to 112 mph, which led the journalists to believe it could have performed better.
                <br><br>
                In CAR Magazine's test with the 911 Turbo, BMW M3, and Audi R8 at Rockingham the GT-R was the fastest. Evo tested the GT-R alongside the 911 GT3 at the Bedford Autodrome circuit, the GT-R ran a 1:21.7 lap time compared to GT3's 1:22.6 time. In a Fifth Gear test with the 911 Turbo, Bruno Senna was able to achieve faster lap times in the GT-R. 
                Car and Driver compared the GT-R on Reno-Fernley Raceway with the 911 Turbo and BMW M3, the GT-R's lap time of 1:26.7 made it the fastest on the track.
                <br><br>
                Road & Track was able to achieve quick lap times with the car on Buttonwillow Raceway, clocking in at 1:56.9 which was over 5 seconds faster than the Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06 and 911 Turbo. In an Edmunds.com 6-way test on the Streets of Willow and an improvised mountain road, the GT-R posted faster times than the Audi R8 and Porsche 911 Carrera. 
                Auto Bild compared the GT-R with the 911 Turbo and V10 Audi R8 at Contidrome, the GT-R's time of 1:30.95 placed it ahead of both the Porsche 911 (1:31.75) and the Audi R8 (1:32.11).
                <br><br>
                In another Autocar comparison with the PDK 911 Turbo (997.2) and V10 Audi R8 on the Castle Combe Circuit the GT-R's laptime of 1:14.6, was faster than the 911's time of 1:14.9 and the R8's 1:15.5 lap time. In December, Auto, Motor und Sport published a comparison between the GT-R, PDK 911 Turbo (997.2) and the Audi R8 V10. Around the 'small' Hockenheimring circuit, 
                the GT-R achieved a time of 1:12.0 against the 911's 1:11.5 and the Audi's 1:12.3. The sport auto magazine had tested the GT-R on the 'small' Hockenheimring circuit and had recorded a lap time of 1:10.7 during the full "supertest".
                <br><br>
                In July 2009, CAR Magazine published a comparison of the revised 911 GT3 (997.2) and the GT-R at the Nurburgring. A time of 7:49 was achieved for the GT3 and 7:51 for the GT-R. It should be noted that these times are not directly comparable to previous Nurburgring tests, as they included a section of track near the pits normally excluded from timing. 
                At Spring Mountain Motorsports Ranch Road and Track managed a 1:20.9 lap time compared to the ZR1's time of 1:20.1 and the 911 Turbo's (997.2) time of 1:21.3. In another Motor Trend comparison at the Streets of Willow, driver Randy Pobst's laptime of 1:20.25 in the facelifted GT-R was slightly faster than the competing Corvette Z06 equipped with optional carbon ceramic brake rotors.
                <br><br>
                On Willow Springs International Motorsports Park, Edmunds.com was able to achieve lap times of 1:25.09 with the 2009 GT-R compared to the Corvette ZR1's time of 1:23.87. Tested by Motor Trend on the Las Vegas Motor Speedway infield road course with a time of 58.1, the GT-R was almost as fast as the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano but 0.6 seconds slower than the 911 GT2 and 1.2 seconds slower than the Corvette ZR1. 
                The driver criticized the GT-R's inferior handling, it finished the comparison test on the last place.
                <br><br>
                The pre-2011 GT-R currently holds a lap time of 1:19.7 around the Top Gear Test Track, with the 2012 GT-R holding a time of 1:17.8, equaling the Pagani Zonda Roadster F (Clubsport Version)'s time from 2008, one second slower than the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport one year before, and being the fastest Japanese car to lap the track. 
                On Top Gear Australia's test track the GT-R posted a lap time of 1:07.06, putting it in second place 0.14 seconds behind the 997 GT2.

            <h2>Racing</h2>
            <h4>Racing History</h4>
            <p>
    
                The 1969 version of the Skyline was a touring car like no other.  
                Taking cues from the Nissan Prince R380 racing prototype, it relied on a four-valve Dual Overhead Cam engine for power and four-wheel independent suspension for its remarkable handling.  
                The car obliterated the competition in Japan's domestic touring races, winning 52 races in its first three years of competition.
                <br><br>
                The first two-door version was introduced in 1970. 
                It was a successful launch and a well-received car, but a global gasoline crisis and a move towards stricter emissions standards put the Skyline on the shelf for a time.
                <br><br>
                From 1972 to 1977, the C110 generation Skyline was produced, this time though it was known as the Datsun K-Series, and four years later it went through another name change – it was now to  be known as the R30.
                <br><br>
                The R30 was a successful and remarkably versatile design, available as a coupe, four-door sedan, five-door hatchback, and  a four-door wagon. 
                All told, the R30 was available in 26 variations, none of them really hinting at what the Skyline would one day become.
                <br><br>
                1986 saw the introduction of the R31. It was a little bigger and boxier than previous models, and was the first to get the famous "Red Top" Skyline engine with red cam covers and the Nissan Induction Control System.
                <br><br>
                It’s important to talk about the Nissan Skyline R31 GTS-R, which was the predecessor of the R32 GT-R, because the car was successful in racing and both models shared certain mechanics. 
                For example, the R31 was the first Nissan with a proprietary 4-wheel steering system, dubbed as the HICAS (High Capacity Active Steering), and it was only the later generations that inherited the system. 
                Unlike other rivaling racing cars, the GT-R had a four-wheel-drive system (ATTESA E-TS) and that was one of the factors which made it so successful.

                <h2>1987 Skyline R31 GTS-R Group A</h2>
                <p>
                    The R31 GTS-R was a ‘Group A’ homologation ‘evolution’ car. In order to qualify for Group A racing in 1987, manufacturers were required to produce a minimum of 5,000 base model vehicles. 
                    For Nissan, the Skyline GTS and GTS-X represented that base model for the R31 series, and easily met the minimum production number requirements. However, when the ‘Group A’ rules changed for the 1987 year, several modifications needed to be made which were not reflected on the existing GTS models. 
                    For example, the rules no longer allowed for electronic wings, an item which was present on the GTS coupe. Instead of requiring manufacturers to produce an additional 5,000 units complying with the new rules, manufacturers need only produce a minimum of 500 ‘evolution’ models reflecting the new changes, and were then allowed to compete in the category. 
                    This is precisely the reason Nissan produced the GTS-R, and the car is said to have provided vital test data and preparation for the re-introduction of the GT-R nameplate on the R32 series. 
                    The GTS-R performed particularly well in the Japanese and Australian touring car championships, as well as having a number of significant achievements through Nissan Motorsport Europe.
                    <br><br>
                    The superior performance of the GTS-R, its low production numbers and thoroughbred racing link as a ‘Group A evolution’ car have made it the most desirable vehicle in the R31 Skyline range. 
                    As GTS-Rs generally bring higher prices than other R31 models, it is therefore important as a prospective purchaser or restorer, to know the relevant features which confirm a car’s authenticity.

                    One year after the roadgoing Skyline GT-R's introduction in 1989, Nissan released the lighter weight NISMO GT-R in 1990, building 560 examples to homologate the GT-R for Group A racing. The NISMO road car allowed Nissan to homologate specific go-fast parts just for racing.

                <p>
                    The GT-R V-Spec was the range-topping model of the R32-generation Nissan Skyline. 
                    Designed for homologation purposes in order for the R32 to compete in Group A racing, the GT-R was upgraded to V-Spec features in 1993. 
                    Production ended in 1994 with only a handful of V-Spec models built. Due to its massive success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, the R32 GT-R was nicknamed "Godzilla."

                <p>
                    The 400R released on the 3rd of November 1997 (the <i>R</i> representing Racing). 
                    <br><br>
                    Overall development and planning was by NISMO (Nissan Motorsports International). But, its bored and stroked RB26DETT engine, the RBX-GT2, was engineered and produced by REINIK.
                    The engine featured 77.7 mm stroke crankshaft (73.7 mm stock), forged 87 mm pistons (86 mm cast stock), upgraded rods, polished ports, high lift camshafts, upgraded oil system, larger exhaust manifolds and higher output turbochargers. 
                    <br><br>
                    NISMO produced an upgraded exhaust, a twin-plate clutch, and intercooler system. Nismo brake pads were fitted to the car. 400R exclusive aerodynamic updates were also added, such as wider bumpers, side skirts, a new rear bumper, a new front bumper with bigger air scoops, and a redesigned bonnet and rear spoiler made of carbon fibre. 
                    <br><br>
                    The 400R was also fitted with 18x10 Nismo LM-GT1s. The car developed 298 kW (400 hp) and 347 lb⋅ft (470 N⋅m), which allowed a top speed of over 300 km/h (186 mph), and enabled it to reach 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 4.0 seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    NISMO had originally planned to produce 100 units of the 400R, however, only 44 units were made before production of the R33 ended in 1998.

                <h2>1998 R33 Skyline GT-R 40th Anniversary Autech</h2>
                <p>
                    Nissan launched a limited edition four-door version of the Skyline GT-R supercar in Japan on 16 January 1998, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Skyline’s debut.
                    <br><br>
                    Just a few hundred examples of this exclusive super-saloon were built by specialist vehicle manufacturer, Autech Japan - a Nissan affiliate company - based on the legendary two-door Skyline GT-R. 
                    The coupe version has long been praised for its spacious rear accommodation, so the four-door version is a natural extension of the GT-R range.
                    <br><br>
                    It featured the same 280 bhp, straight six engine as the two-door GT-R, developing 271 lb ft of torque and offering blistering performance, with its 0-60mph time of just 5.4 seconds. 
                    The four-door offers the same outstanding handling characteristics as the coupe, thanks to its state-of-the-art chassis.
                    <br><br>
                    All-round multi-link suspension is complemented by a highly sophisticated four-wheel steering system called HICAS, which gives the car razor-sharp turn-in characteristics and excellent mid-bend stability. 
                    At the same time, the ATTESA E-TS electronic torque split system controls the delivery of power to each of the four wheels.
                    <br><br>
                    Under normal driving conditions, 100 per cent of the power is directed to the rear wheels, but during fast acceleration or cornering, when extra traction is required, up to 50 per cent of the torque can be directed to the front wheels.
                    <br><br>
                    Styling of the four-door was carried out by Autech and features specially designed, flared front and rear wings, rear doors, sill protectors and protective rear side mouldings, as well as a new front bumper. 
                    The car was available in three colours – pearlescent purple, metallic silver and white.
                    <br>

                <h2>2003 R34 Skyline GT-R R34 'Z-Tune'</h2>
                <p>
                    Nismo originally designed the concept of the Z-tune in 2002 when Nissan was putting an end to the R34 Skyline production. The first Z-tune was built in 2003, using a used 2002 Skyline GT-R V·Spec II. 
                    It was built with a concept RB26DETT 'Z1' engine. This engine was based on Nissan's Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. As with the racing vehicles a strengthened engine block and stroked crankshaft were utilised. 
                    The engine was also bored, rith the new displacement of 2.8L and upgraded turbo-chargers the Z1 produced 373 kW (500 hp). The Z-Tune had a 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of over 327 km/h (203 mph).
                    <br><br>
                    Nismo was then given the approval from Nissan to build Z-tune models for the Nismo anniversary. Nismo then purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V·Spec, each with less than 29,000 km (18,000 miles) on the clock, they were then completely stripped and were resprayed to a "Z-tune Silver," a special colour exclusively for the Z-tune.
                    One car was left in its original colour of Midnight Purple III. For each of the 18 production models, the 2.8L engine was revised to allow it to reach 8000 rpm. The turbochargers were supplied by IHI in Japan. 
                    The engine is advertised as making as much as 373 kW (500 hp) (for warranty reasons). This second revision of the Z-tune engine is called the 'Z2'. The bodywork is designed with the same functional components used in Nismo's GT500 racing cars, such as engine bay vents on the bonnet and bumpers, as well as wider arches for wider wheels. 
                    The Z-tune is also improved with an aggressive suspension setup from Sachs, and a specially designed Brembo brake system.
                    <br><br>
                    The entire car is essentially handmade, with the car being completely stripped and re-built from the chassis up. Engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas such as the door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay, 
                    completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. 
                    Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes). The Z-tune is often regarded as the most expensive (prices for some have been known to exceed US$290,000) street legal GT-R ever built.

                <h2>2002 R34 Skyline GT-R M-Spec Nur and Spec II Nur</h2>
                <p>
                    The Nisan GT-R V-Spec II Nür was the final R34 production model, released in in February 2002. Named after the Nürburging in Germany where the R34 was developed, the Nür editions share most of its components with any other series II R34 GT-R - but not in the engine bay.
                    <br><br>
                    Nür models were fitted with an updated RB26DETT engine featuring a strengthened block based on Nissan's N1 race engine. Bigger turbos were added with stronger blades which increased lag, but supported much more power.
                    While claimed power output remained at 206kW (even though they'd leave the factory with around 246kW), the new block and turbochargers allowed tuners to increase output up to 340kW relatively simply and safely.
                    <br><br>
                    And while previous GT-R models used Nissan’s five-speed, Nür models gained a six-speed made by Getrag. Brembo brake calipers were standard equipment, as was the bodykit based on the V Spec II with carbon fibre reinforced plastic bonnet.
                    <br><br>
                    Exclusive to Nür models was a speedometer the read up to 300km/h, gold-colored N1 engine covers, interior stitching with iridium interior trim pieces and a gold VIN plate.
                    The final GT-R Nür editions are also very rare. Around 1000 we're made (Nissan initially intended to make 500 units, but that was increased to 1000 customers demanded), but only 300 V Spec II-based Nür GT-Rs were delivered to customers, making them very desirable and fetching high prices at auctions.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h2>2019 R35 GT-R50</h2>
                <p>
                    First shown in prototype form at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July, the GT-R50 has lost little in its transition to production model, with buyers able to specify their own colour combinations inside and out in collaboration with Italdesign.
                    The GT-R50 celebrates the 50th anniversaries of the GT-R and Italdesign, which occur in 2019 and 2018 respectively. 
                    <br><br>
                    The GT-R Nismo-based GT-R50 are committed to production with each of the bespoke supercar’s 50 units priced from €990,000 ($A1.57 million) before taxes ahead of deliveries starting next year.
                    <br><br>
                    The all-wheel drive GT-R50 takes the GT-R Nismo’s 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine and increase its outputs by about 89kW/118Nm, to 530kW/780Nm.
                    <br><br>
                    These gains are thanks to competition-spec turbochargers, larger intercoolers, high-flow piston oil jets, revised camshaft profiles, high-flow fuel injectors, optimised ignition, and revised intake and exhaust systems.
                    Other mechanical upgrades include a strengthened six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, continually adjustable suspension and Brembo brake calipers (six-piston front, four-piston rear).
                    <br><br>
                    Longer, wider and lower, the GT-R50 features several unique exterior design elements that clearly identify it as a GT-R variant with a lot more flair, while its interior is no different.
                    <br>
