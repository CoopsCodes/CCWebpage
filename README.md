Description of my website.
•    Purpose – the purpose of my website for this project is to primarily act as a resume for future employers and show off my current skillsets. But my purpose of this website is to keep changing and developing it as I grow, using it as a testing ground for new languages and skills, the blog pre-dates this project (that’s why it looks different) and that has already gone through multiple iterations, and I am planning another change to it as we speak.
•    Functionality/Features – my site was built for Desktop, but it scales for both Tablet and Mobile and it is highly recommended you view it on a desktop or tablet as the front-page grid wont scale to mobile.  My main functionality was to make the front page look like a crossword was being filled out when you first load in, this took a lot of grid work.

•    Target Audience – absolutely future employers and my mother at this stage
•    Tech stack – it is totally build in HTML/CSS, I wanted to incorporate some JavaScript to make the letters on the main page look like they were drawn in rather that fade in but I was advised against that at this stage.

Design Documentation and Details of the Planning Process
•    Design process, 

First iteration –
As the images below demonstrate my first iteration was to create a half wrap around border, this was started on the weekend before we got the assignment, I turned on this pretty quickly and found that I hadn’t done enough planning before I started.

Second design attempt
Second wave of design was inspired by the image below, I originally settled on a look of a periodic table, I wanted the tiles to flip as you hovered over them displaying more information on what was in that page.  I also designed some fallback static but clean designs in case I got stuck and had overreached.

Third design 
The final redesign came as I built my plan in FIgma, the look of my grid and the simple layout made it look like a crossword, and I liked that.  The idea of flipping tiles turned into looking like a written word or being typed in.

I would grow to hate this design as I struggled to get the fade in image to work, and at one stage I was about to give up, but a fellow student overheard my problem and knew the answer, potentially saving many more tears and a breakdown/redesign scenario.

Short Answer Q&A.

1.    Key elements in the development of the internet.
In 1982 the internet went public after ARPANET developed the first TCP/IP packet switching technologies, packets allowed networks to communicate over a shared network leading to the World Wide Web (WWW).
The WWW was developed by a Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a graduate from Oxford University who, while working at CERN wanted to fix the problem the scientists were having sharing information, initially the proposal was turned down, but Sir Berners-Lee was allowed to work on it and developed.
•    HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language ) – the formatting language.
•    URI (Uniform Resource Identifier – otherwise known as URL, a unique web address.
•    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – allowing for the retrieval of resources from the web.
After a call was made by Tim to the internet community for help with interfaces Mosaic launched in 1993 created by Marc Andreessen, who would go on and create Netscape.
Netscape’s beta launched in October 1994 and introduced Secure Sockets Layer SSL encryption in 1995, the same year Brendan Eich developed Javascript allowing for interactive elements to HTML pages.
September 15th 1997 Google.com is registered and goes live in 1998.

2.    Relationships of the fundamental aspects of the Internet.
•    Domains: are part of the system in which internet addresses are linked to specific locations on the internet.  It is your own internet address registered as part of a national or international internet domain.
•    Web Servers: a web server is a computer that stores the components of a website, such as the HTML/CSS/JS files, it is connected to the internet for sharing those files with other devices connected over the internet.  It does this through the HTTP server, a device sends a HTTP Request to the Web Server that then validates it by returning a HTTP Response (or a 404)
•    DNS: the Domain Name System is a registry that translates domain names (i.e facebook.com) into IP (internet Protocol) addresses, the long complex alphanumeric addresses.
•    Web Browsers: are software applications that locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web.  Basically, the interface that deciphers all the JavaScript.

3.    Reflection on one aspect of the Internet.
One aspect I found the most interesting was Sir Tim Berner-Lee’s accidental invention of the World Wide Web, only intending to create a platform for scientists to share information and of frustration of the CERN computers holding different information and requiring knowledge of different languages to access different information he developed the foundation that we still use, HTML.
Going onto found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and still the Director, the W3C is the main international standards organisation.
HTML by todays standard looks quite simple, and that’s because when it was developed the complex applications we have now didn’t exist, the internet has grown into a convoluted branch of systems that still uses HTML.
