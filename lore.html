            <p>Totally <i>self-indulgent</i> plug</p>
            <p>I’m a nerdy/gamer/free-spirit type of person that hates talking about myself, so I’ll make this short.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of my 7-year banking career I re-evaluated what my passions are and decided my heart (and future) was no longer in banking.</p>
            <p>But while working in an IT project team I developed a taste for Tech, and after conversing with a close friend and fellow Bootcamp graduate, I realised enrolling in a Developers' Bootcamp was the way to go.</p>
            <p>Like a sponge I want to absorb everything, I love the design of front-end and the challenge of back-end, so I will gladly consider any area.  But the job I accept will depend on the team I work with, so if you think you might like to add me to the team, introduce me to them.</p>
